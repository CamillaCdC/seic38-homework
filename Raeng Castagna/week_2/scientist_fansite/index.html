    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper, was born in New York City in 1906. She was one of the first computer programmers to work on the Harvard Mark I. She was also a United States Navy rear admiral, helped develop COBOL -- one of the first high-level programming languages -- and invented the first compiler, a program that translates programming code to machine language.</p>
    <p>Grace invented on of the first linkers, and was instramental in popuralising the idea of machine-independent programming languages. She believed it was "much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols... so decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code." </p>
