// Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
// Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
// Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
// Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.
