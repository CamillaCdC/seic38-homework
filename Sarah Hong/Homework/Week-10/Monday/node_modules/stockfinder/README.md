<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this project to easily query the IEX Cloud database of stock
information for my own use. I originally started by looking for packages that
already offered this and there was none that was updated. I then created this
package to allow for a much more streamlined approach to do this.

### Built With

* [NPM](https://nodejs.org)
* [request-promise-native](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with using this package follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the latest version of NPM for this project to work.
* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the Stock-Finder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/austinmccalley/Stock-Finder.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Build JS File

```sh
tsc
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here is a code sample of how to do a simple request for $TSLA stock information
using the package with the ``getStock()`` function.

```javascript
const stockFinder = require('stockfinder');

/*
  Declare the Stock Finder with
  the parameters you want
*/
const sf = new stockfinder('stable', 'TSLA', apiKey, false);

/*
  Call the get stock function and then wait
  for the promise to return
*/
sf.getStock().then(res => {
  console.log(res)
});
```

If you want to get multiple stocks you will use the ``getStocks()`` function.

```javascript
const stockFinder = require('stockfinder');

/*
  Declare the Stock Finder with
  the parameters you want
*/
const sf = new stockfinder('stable', ['TSLA','AAPL'], apiKey, false);

/*
  Call the get stocks function and then wait
  for the promise to return
*/
sf.getStocks().then(res => {
  console.log(res)
});
```

### *Note*

Sometimes IEX Cloud has issues with normal requests, you can switch to using a
CURL request instead by following the example.

```javascript
const stockFinder = require('stockfinder');

/*
  Declare the Stock Finder with
  the parameters you want
*/
const sf = new stockfinder('stable', 'TSLA', apiKey, true);

/*
  Call the get stock function and then wait
  for the promise to return
*/
sf.getStock().then(res => {
  console.log(res)
});
```
