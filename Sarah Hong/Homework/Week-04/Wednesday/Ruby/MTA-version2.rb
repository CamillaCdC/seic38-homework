# MTA Lab

# The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the journey and the total number of stops for the trip in the console:
#
# plan_trip 'N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd' # This is only a suggested function name and signature.
#

# All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.)
# Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
