    <p> Trivia

    Donald Knuth used to pay 2.56$ for every mistake found in one of his books.

    He published 2 scientific papers in the year he completed his undergraduate degree – quite an achievement.

    He lacked confidence and did not believe in himself at school – the reason his teachers did not consider him capable of success despite his apparent talents.

    He was a member of American Guild or Organists and designed his own pipe organ.

    Knuth has been called “the father of analysis of algorithms”.

    Donald Knuth is a Lutheran and the author of 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated – an analysis of the Bible using scientific methods.
