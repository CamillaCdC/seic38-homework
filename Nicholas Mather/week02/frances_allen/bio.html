    <h2>Frances Allen:</h2>
    <h3>Climbing the mountain of optimisation</h3>

    <p>
      Frances Allen, mostly known as Fran, was born in Peru, New York on August 4th, 1932. She had a rural upbringing, living on a farm and attending a one-room schoolhouse a mile away from her home before moving to a local high school. In 1954, she graduated from the New York State College for Teachers with a Bachelor of Science and taught at a school in her hometown. Two years later, she enrolled at the University of Michigan, earning a Master of Science Degree in mathematics in 1957.

    <p>
      With two degrees under her belt, Fran had a deep knowledge base but empty pockets with significant student loan debt. In an effort to get on top of her finances, Fran took a job at IBM, teaching FORTRAN to new hires. Intending to work at IBM only until she was clear of debt, she would instead end up spending her entire career at IBM.

      Fran took on a number of challenges in her 40-year career that started before the invention of the microprocessor and continued until 2002, well into the age of the personal computer. Some notable projects include but are not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Working on the Alpha programming language
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing compiler-optimization teams for the Harvest code-breaking project and IBM’s Stretch project
      </li>
      <li>
        Sabbaticals and adjunct work at both New York University and Stanford
      </li>
      <li>
        Helped develop parallel computing and worked on software for the Blue Gene supercomputer
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      She was published many times, and in 2006 became the first woman to win the Turing award, widely regarded as the Nobel prize of computing, for her work that “laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology.” Along with her Turing award, Allen won the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award and Computer Pioneer Award in 1997 and 2004 respectively. She was recognised as a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Computer History Museum and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fran was recognised by her former employer as the first IBM Fellow in 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from her professional life, Fran Allen was a proficient mountaineer and passionate environmentalist. A member of the American Alpine club and the Alpine Club of Canada, she participated in expeditions to the arctic and on the border between China and Tibet. Drawing together her love for the mountains and her scientific career, Fran remarked, in a 2001 interview: “And, you know, it’s somewhat of the same sort of thing: it’s kind of challenging, and interesting; and how does one involve oneself in it? What capabilities does one bring to it that will make a difference?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Allen died in 2020, aged 88, on her birthday. She is remembered as both a technical and social pioneer, for her grounbreaking work and as the first woman to be recognised with the highest award in the field of computer science.
