  <p>In December 1987 American programmer and linguist Larry Wall first released Perl 1.0 for computers running the UNIX operating system. This first version was an intuitive, easily coded language for scanning, extracting, and printing information from text files; in addition, Perl could handle many system management tasks. Perl, which has sometimes been said to stand for “practical extraction and report language,” was influenced by existing programming languages—such as C, BASIC, and AWK—but it also reflected Wall’s linguistic background in its extensive use of common English words. Perl was a landmark product in advocating the open-source model—a collaborative, rather than proprietary, approach to software development—earning Wall the 1996 Dr. Dobb’s Excellence in Programming Award and the Free Software Foundation’s Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.</p>
