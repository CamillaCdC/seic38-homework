<div id='divLeft'>
    <h2 id='paddingTop'>Summary</h2>
    - This lab will help you practice JavaScript functions and manipulating the DOM with jQuery.
    - You'll be selecting elements, manipulating HTML, and manipulating style along
    with building out the logic using JavaScript.

    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <p>DOM selection, appending, removal, updating</p>
</div>
    <h3>Specification:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Keep track of the checking and savings balances somewhere</li><br>
  <li>Add functionality so that a user can deposit money into one of the bank accounts.</li><br>
  <li>Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page
  so a user can see the change.</li><br>
  <li>Add functionality so that a user can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts.</li><br>
  <li>Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page
    so a user can see the change.</li><br>
  <li>Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to
  withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.</li><br>
  <li>When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account
  should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account.</li><br>
  <li>What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking
  account than is in the account? These accounts have overdraft protection, so if
  a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking
  balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account.
  If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.</li><br>
  <li>Make sure there is overdraft protection going both ways.</li><br>
  <li>Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer?</li><br>
</ol>
