        <p class="quotes">“Young man, in mathematics you don’t understand things. You just get used to them.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“Computers are like humans – they do everything except think.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“Truth is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you tell me precisely what it is a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.”</p>
        <p class="quotes">“It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“Technological possibilities are irresistible to man. If man can go to the moon, he will. If he can control the climate, he will.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“All stable processes we shall predict. All unstable processes we shall control.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“There probably is a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn’t.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“There’s no sense in being precise when you don’t even know what you’re talking about.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“When we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language built on the primary language of the nervous system.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“You don’t have to be responsible for the world that you’re in.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“I am thinking about something much more important than bombs. I am thinking about computers.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“Science, as well as technology, will in the near and in the farther future increasingly turn from problems of intensity, substance, and energy, to problems of structure, organization, information, and control.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“The total subject of mathematics is clearly too broad for any of us. I do not think that any mathematician since Gauss has covered it uniformly and fully; even Hilbert did not and all of us are of considerably lesser width quite apart from the question of depth than Hilbert.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“I would like to make a confession which may seem immoral: I do not believe in Hilbert space anymore.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“You wake me up early in the morning to tell me I am right? Please wait until I am wrong.”
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">“The emphasis on mathematical methods seems to be shifted more towards combinatorics and set theory – and away from the algorithm of differential equations which dominates mathematical physics.”
