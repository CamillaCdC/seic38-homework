        <p>(This biography was published in the first edition of "The Hacker's Dictionary".
            It is copyright 1983 Richard Stallman and released under the Creative Commons
            Share alike license 3.0.) I was built at a laboratory in Manhattan around 1953,
            and moved to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971. My hobbies include affection, international folk dance, flying, cooking, physics, recorder, puns, science fiction fandom, and programming; I magically get paid for doing the last one. About a year ago I split up with the PDP-10 computer to which I was married for ten years. We still love each other, but the world is taking us in different directions. For the moment I still live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, among our old memories. "Richard Stallman" is just my mundane name; you can call me "rms".
