    <h2>Norbert Wiener was a great thinker and a tortured person</h2>

        Wiener himself, perhaps not unsurprisingly given his upbringing,
        believed that <span
          >“society’s understanding of mental illness could benefit greatly from
          the lessons afforded by the new brain-like computing machines”</span

        He suggested that many human mental disorders were "fundamentally
        diseases of memory, of the circulating information kept by the brain in
        the active state"
      </p>
      <p>
        He explained how modern problems such as "malignant worry", anxiety
        attacks and other classic neurotic disorders might start with a
        relatively trivial concern and "build itself up into a process totally
        destructive to the ordinary mental life"
      </p>
      <p>
        just as a
        <span>computer caught up in a logical paradox</span> "may go into a
        circular process which there seems to be no way to stop"
