            Psychologically scarred by his fatherâ€™s brutal attempts to mold and
            promote him as a prodigy, he was the quintessential outsider. His
            social ineptitude was notorious. He would snore sonorously through
            academic meetings and enthusiastically pick his nose while
            delivering lectures. <br /><br />"When he walked the halls of MIT he
            invariably read a book, running his finger along the wall to keep
            track of where he was going. One day, engaged in this activity,
            Wiener passed a classroom where a class was in session. It was a hot
            day and the door had been left open. But of course Wiener was
            unaware of these details - he followed his finger through the door,
            into the classroom, around the walls (right past the lecturer) and
            out the door again. - Excerpt, Mathematical Conversations by Krantz
            (2001)
