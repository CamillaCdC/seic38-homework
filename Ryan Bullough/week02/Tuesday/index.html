      <article>
        <p>
          Best known as the inventor of Cybernetics - the theoretical foundation
          which has given us servomechanisms, artificial intelligence and
          neuroscience
        </p>
        <p>
          A
          <a href="absentminded-professor.html">Famously eccentric</a> and
          <a href="depression.html">tortured</a>
          individual, Wiener feared for the future based on two fundamental
          convictions
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We humans canâ€™t resist selfishly misusing the powers our machines
            give us
          </li>
          <li>+</li>
          <li>
            We couldn't control the machines that we built to make decisions on
            their own
          </li>

        <blockquote>
          "The world of the future will be an ever more demanding struggle
          against the limitations of our intelligence, not a comfortable hammock
          in which we can lie down to be waited upon by our robot slaves."
